# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/krisozolins/laravelpackageexample).

An interesting read is [Contributing to a Github Project](http://jasonlewis.me/article/contributing-to-a-github-project).

Also try to code in the same style as Laravel (which followes the [PSR standard](http://www.php-fig.org/) guidelines). StyleCI is set up to fix any discrepancies.

# Things you could do

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, this list provides some starting points.

- Add license text
- Remove rewriteRules.php
- Set up TravisCI, StyleCI, ScrutinizerCI
- Write a comprehensive ReadMe
- Test for several commands, as well as the different options.
- Test the Conveyor and Wrapping on their own.
- Test `publish` and `tests` command.
- Removing a package leaves (multiple) whitespaces in app.php and composer.json. Can this be done differently?

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
